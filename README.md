Important note : We are primary focused on 2D at the Moment. 3D Might come around Alpha 2.0. If you would wanna make 3D games, you are gonna need to do a lot of things.

This library transforms instructions into Pixels.<br />
You can use this as a surface. Make cool 3D (maybe) and 2D stuff!<br />
Also includes a Test Class!

#Releases

PixelGL is currently only in Pre-Alpha 1.4<br />
Public Releases and the Website will be out as soon as we enter Alpha 1.0
